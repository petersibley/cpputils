You'll want to install the latest cmake
`brew install cmake` 
`brew install ninja`

Clangformat and friends can be installed via LLVM

`brew install llvm`

You might need to add them to your path as XCode also has it's own much older version.

It appears to get installed here:

`/usr/local/opt/llvm@5/bin/clang-format` 

You can also install doxygen as well.

`brew install doxygen`
